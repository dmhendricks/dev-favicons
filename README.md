# Favicons for web developers

I started a collection of favicons and app icons that are intended to be used by developers to differentiate among different browsers tabs for sites and development environments.

It is not uncommon that web developers have many tabs open - sometimes with multiple environemnts (such as development/testing, staging, production, etc). I like to use different icons to make the tabs' environments perceptible to avoid the annoyance of accidentally doing something to the wrong site.

## TODO

* Create some visibly noticeable favicons/app icons
* Make it easy with a WordPress plugin
* Maybe find a gracious CDN to host the tiny images on

## Sources/Attribution

Icons without attribution were created by the owner of this repo.
